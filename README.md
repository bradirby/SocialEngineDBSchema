## TESTING CCNET Get Lastest

Documentation for the SocialEngine Database, in the form of HTML documentation files.


### What is this repository for? ###

In the Code folder, open the index.html file for full documentation of the database.  Descriptions of the fields and tables
will be forthcoming as I figure out what they are for.

This is all contained in a Visual Studio solution, but that is unimportant for consuming the documentation.  There are C# classes for the 
database tables, but would probably be easily converted to other languages as necessary.

### How do I get set up? ###

There is nothing to setup.  This is reference only.

### Contribution guidelines ###

Please contribute descriptions of fields and tables.  You may update the HTML files to add the descriptions as necessary, then send me a PR.

### Who do I talk to? ###
